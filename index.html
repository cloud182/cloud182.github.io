								<b>Research Interests:</b> I started my career in Astronomy studying active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the impact they have on their host galaxy.
								In particular, I focused on the study of their most extended structures both in the optical (the extended narrow-line region) and in the radio band.
								Towards the end of my Ph.D., my interest shifted more towards normal star-forming galaxies, the impact of star formation on their structure and evolution
								and the properties of the ionized gas. Right now, I am principally interested in identifying, classifying and characterizing ionized nebulae in nearby star-forming
								galaxies observed by MUSE.

								<b><a href="www.phangs.org">PHANGS</a></b>
								<br>As a member of the PHANGS collaboration, my interest focuses on the identification, classification andf characterization of ionized nebulae in the PHANGS-MUSE sample.
								In particular, I am focusing in developing new automatic ways to classify nebulae taking advantage of the wealth of information that can be recovered from the MUSE datacubes.
								I recently published a first work on this topic, that focuses on using a model-comparison-based algorithm to classifify the most common classes of nebulae (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230203062C/abstract">link</a>).
								I am also a member of the PHANGS-MUSE team, and I contribute to the reduction and analysis of the MUSE data acquired by the collaboration.

								<b><a href="https://www.sdss.org/">SDSS-V</a></b>
								<br>I am a member of the Local Volume Mapper (LVM) science team. I joined the collaboration during my postdoc at Universidad de Chile.
								I am interested in the new view that LVM will give us on the Milky Way, which will allow to finally connect Galactic to extragalactic physics.
								As part of the team, I developed, in collaboration with Oleg Egorov, the <a href="https://github.com/sdss/lvmdatasimulator">LVM data simulator</a>, a software that allows to simulate raw and reduced
								LVM data and that can be used as a tool to plan observations but also for forward modeling studies, since it allows to compare detailed simulations
							    of nebulae or other objects with the actual results of LVM observations
